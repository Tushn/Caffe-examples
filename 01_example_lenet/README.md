# General

This code is version an example of [01-example-lenet](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/examples/01-learning-lenet.ipynb) from Caffe, but this version is made for Python3. This project is made for full components.

# Installation

I recommend which you install Caffe for python by Anaconda, using command below (see this [link](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/caffe) for new versions):
```
conda install -c conda-forge caffe 
conda install -c conda-forge/label/broken caffe 
```
